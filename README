Hash-My-pAss is a Javascript bookmarklet that generates a password for a given site by hashing a master password with the site's domain.

This way you'll have the advantage of memorizing only a single password, without the security problems of sharing passwords across sites.

The hash transformation doesn't allow anyone who has the final password to guess the master password. And since the hash is always the same, there's no need to store anything, it can simply be calculated on the fly every time it is used. As a javascript bookmarklet, it works on the client side, so the master password is never sent through the network.
