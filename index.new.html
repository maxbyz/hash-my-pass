        Hash My Pass is a Javascript bookmarklet
        that generates passwords guaranteed to be unique for each site
        so you'll never have to reuse the same password for different sites,
        which, as everyone knows, is a security risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great thing is, you only have to memorize a single master password,
        and this is NEVER stored anywhere.
        At the same time, you're without the security problems of sharing passwords across sites.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="why">
        password reuse is unsafe.
        but remembering different passwords is inconvenient
    </section>
    <section id="how">
      <p>
        The main concept is based on <b>hashing a single master password
        with the current site's domain</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hash is not encryption – it cannot be decrypted back to the original text
        (it is a "one-way" cryptographic function).
        Therefore, <b>it is impossible to obtain the master password
        from the generated site-specific password</b>,
        so even if your acount on one website is compromised,
        all the other accounts are perfectly safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the hash is always the same given the same inputs,
        it can be generated on-the-fly, so there's no need to store anything:
        <b>none of the generated passwords are stored anywhere</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a javascript bookmarklet, it works on the client side,
        which means that <b>the master password is never sent through the network</b>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="who">
      <p>
        Hash My Pass was started as a team project for Codebits 2011.
        The team members <b>Waldir Pimenta</b>, <b>Abel Soares</b>,
        <b>Sérgio Laranjeira</b> and <b>Miguel Oliveira</b>
        had to complete the project from scratch in 48 hours
        for the Codebits competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original idea was inspired in Nic Wolff's
        <a href="http://angel.net/~nic/passwd.sha1.1a.html">Password generator</a>.
        Hash My Pass improves upon Nic's generator in the following ways:
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It is hosted on a publicly available version-control platform (github),
          and can easily be improved by others, be forked, have pages translated,
          issues reported, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          It attempts to cater to the different password requirements
          (length, allow/forbid alphanum/symbols, etc.) that each site implements.
        </li>
        <li>
          It uses a less cheap hack than appending "1a" to the generated password
          to make sure that at least a letter and a number is included
          (and only does so when relevant to the particular site)
        </li>
        <li>
          The bookmarklet prompt doesn't mask the pass.
          That isn't possible using Javascript's native popup boxes.
          We solved this by using a lightbox-type prompt emulator
          that uses an <code>&lt;input type="password"&gt;</code>
          to provide the masking using HTML's native mechanisms
        </li>
        <li>
          The domain recognition code uses a more powerful regex
          in order to cover edge cases (country-specific TLDs, for instance).
        </li>
      </ul>

        <dt>What if someone finds my master password?</dt>
        <dd>
          Well, what if they found the current password you use in most websites?
          Of course Hash My Pass is not 100% secure (nothing is),
          but it’s still safer than reusing passwords.
        </dd>
        <dt>Does this also save my username?</dt>
        <dd>
          No. it is very rare to be able to keep your username across websites, so this wouldn’t be very useful.
          besides, most browsers may save username/password combinations
          (Of course, make sure to not let other people use your browser profile).
